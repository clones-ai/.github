CLONES is building the next frontier of automation : \
\
**"A world where anyone can train, tokenize, and execute their own digital agent capable of replicating anything a human can do on a computer."**

This marks the evolution from **LLMs (Large Language Models) to VLMs (Vision Large Action Models)** ‚Äî from _thinking_ agents to _doing_ agents. While AI can already write, summarize, and suggest, **Computer Use Agents (CUAs) can now act**, replicating entire human workflows across desktop environments with superhuman precision and 24/7 availability.

Every person, every profession will be able to **clone their know-how** into a digital agent that works for them, 24/7, offering services, improving productivity, and powering the next generation of the AI workforce.

Our mission is to democratize access to this technology
