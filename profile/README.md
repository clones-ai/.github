# The Vision

CLONES is building the next frontier of automation : \
\
**"A world where anyone can train, tokenize, and execute their own digital agent capable of replicating anything a human can do on a computer."**

This marks the evolution from **LLMs (Large Language Models) to VLMs (Vision Large Action Models)** — from _thinking_ agents to _doing_ agents. While AI can already write, summarize, and suggest, **Computer Use Agents (CUAs) can now act**, replicating entire human workflows across desktop environments with superhuman precision and 24/7 availability.

Every person, every profession will be able to **clone their know-how** into a digital agent that works for them, 24/7, offering services, improving productivity, and powering the next generation of the AI workforce.

Our mission is to democratize access to this technology — by letting anyone:

Record a workflow -> Convert it into a dataset -> Fine-tune a model  -> Tokenize an agent -> execute it

CLONES is built on three interoperable pillars :

**The Forge** – for decentralized datasets generation & fine-tuning\
**The Launchpad** – to tokenize & deploy agents on-chain\
**The Sandbox** – to execute token gated agents in real-world desktop environments

Each of these pillars is a standalone product, designed with its own sustainable, self-contained revenue model, yet fully integrated into powering into CLONES ecosystem.

The $CLONES token sits at the heart of the ecosystem

Every dataset forged, agent tokenized or executed strengthens the utility of $CLONES.

With a global AI data and automation market projected to grow from $8.6B to $236B+ by 2030.

CLONES is building the rails for the most valuable part of that future: \
\
**Human-like agents trained by humans, for humans.**
