# CLONES

CLONES is building the next frontier of automation:

"A world where anyone can capture their digital expertise, tokenize it, and trade it as training data — creating liquid markets for human knowledge."

This marks the evolution from assistants that only think to agents that actually do. While traditional AI models can write, summarize and suggest, Computer-Use Agents (CUAs) can now act — navigating interfaces, executing workflows and automating entire tasks with precision and 24/7 availability.

For the first time, human demonstrations of computer use become valuable assets. Every person, every profession will be able to transform their know-how into tokenized datasets that power AI agents, creating new sources of income, productivity, and opportunity in the emerging data economy.

Our mission is to democratize access to this technology by decentralizing the data layer itself — ensuring that those who create the expertise also own and profit from it.
