1 Viralmind's Mission
At ViralMind, our mission is to revolutionize AI automation by enabling computer-use agents to learn directly from human demonstrations at scale. We believe that the future of AI is agentic, meaning AI systems should be capable of performing real-world tasks on a computer just as a human wouldâ€” navigating software, managing files, automating workflows, and executing complex multi-step operations.

We are building an open and scalable ecosystem where AI can be trained efficiently, fairly rewarded, and deployed in a way that benefits both businesses and users.
